# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Introduction
This Tic Tac Toe game is a simple, web-based version of the classic game also known as Noughts and Crosses. I made this game in 2022, and it provides a fun and interactive way for two players to compete in a game of strategy and luck.

## Features
- Interactive, web-based gameplay for two players.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Tracks the score of both players across sessions.
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile browsers.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Setup and Running the Game
To run this game, you will need a web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Follow these steps to get the game up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`
  ```bash
git clone https://github.com/sherwinvishesh/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
```
3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
  ```bash
 cd Tic-Tac-Toe
```
5. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

Alternatively, you can set up a local server using Python or any other simple HTTP server and serve the game directly from there.


## How to Play
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. Players take turns putting their marks (either an O or an X) in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is declared a draw.
